			<h3>[ My boigraphy]</h3>
		 <p>
			My name is  Richard Ou . I live in Mingjian Township, Nantou County. I am currently studying in the second year of the Foreign Languages Department of Tsinghua University. I major in German as a second language. The crowd is crowded, and there are no employees at home, so I started helping my parents with household chores since I was a child. Even if I was studying in other counties and cities during high school and college, I would go home to help during the rest of the vacation except the weekends when I had to prepare for exams.<br>
            My job is to sell candy, biscuits, and beverages to passing travelers, while my parents serve tea-buying guests. Because this job requires long-term contact with different people, I'm not afraid to meet people, even if it's all at once. I was able to complete the work smoothly even though there were a lot of guests, which is also a valuable experience I learned from them.
           In school, I joined the department's basketball team and practiced with my seniors and juniors. In addition to maintaining my sports habits, I also cultivated and expanded my interpersonal relationships<br>.
            My hobby is assembling models. When the model is assembled, in addition to having a sense of accomplishment, I also hone my care and patience in the process. At the beginning of assembling the model, I suffered a lot when I was in a hurry. Now I can really do a good job in every step and I will never swallow it whole. It also makes me realize that doing a thing well is not easy. 
			<br>我是歐景瑞，住在南投縣名間鄉，目前就讀清華大學外文系二年級，第二語言主修德文，家裡從事茶業零售的行業，因為處於旅遊區內，所以假日會湧入大量的人潮，再加上家裡沒有聘請員工，所以從小便開始幫父母分擔家事，就算是高中與大學階段在外縣市讀書，除了要準備考試的周末以外，其餘休假時間都會回家幫忙。
            我的工作是販售糖果、餅乾以及飲料給路過的旅客，而父母則是招待買茶的客人，因為這份工作需要長時間接觸不同的人，所以我並不會害怕接觸人群，就算一下子來了非常多客人，我還是能夠順利地完成工作，這也是我在其中學習到的寶貴經驗。
            在學校裡，我參加系上的籃球隊，一起與學長學弟共同練球，除了持續自己的運動習慣之外，同時也培養與拓展自己的人際關係。
            我的愛好是組裝模型，當模型組裝完成後，除了有成就感之外，過程中也磨練我的細心與耐心，剛開始組裝模型這件事讓性子急的我吃了不少苦頭；不過我現在能夠確實的把每個環節做好，絕不囫圇吞棗，這也讓我體認到做好一件事是非常不容易的。
