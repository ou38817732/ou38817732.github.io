		My name is Richard Ou. I have studied in the department of foreign language and literature at NTHU for two years. I have the habit of doing exercises such as playing basketball and baseball. By the way, I often watch the CPBL and NBA games too in my leisure time. My hobby is assembling plastic models like fighters, battleships, and tanks in WWII. So my room was overwhelmed by those models. Frankly saying, I am surprised that  I study FLL department at NTHU. In my senior time, I always expect myself can enter medical school in the future. However, the truth proves that I am wrong. Math, physic, and chemistry are more difficult than before. Because I can't hold these three subjects very well, I give up the idea of becoming a doctor. After I enrolled in FLL, I find out an interesting thing. That there is plenty of resources for learning in NTHU. And I still learned a lot of things in the period.
