        			<h2>[Sec.#1] What is D-Day?</h2>
        		    <p><span class="joint"> &#9658; </span>D-day is a military term that refers to the day when a combat operation is launched. On June 6, 1944, British, American, Canadian, and French troops landed on the northern coast of France against German troops. It was the largest military operation in history at the time. And it symbolized the beginning of the campaign to liberate Northwestern Europe. These areas had previously been occupied by the Nazis.
                    D-day 是一個軍事術語，指的是作戰行動開始的那一天。 <br>1944 年 6 月 6 日，英、美、加、法三軍在法國北部海岸登陸對抗德軍，這是當時歷史上規模最大的軍事行動。它像徵著解放西北歐的運動的開始，而這些地區以前曾被納粹佔領。

                   <h3>[Sec.#2] What happened in D-day</h3>                   
                    <p><span class="joint">&#9658;</span>In the early morning of D-day, the Allied airborne troop dropped behind the enemy line; thousands of battleships gathered on the coast of Normandy, preparing to launch an attack. Although the German military leaders expected that there would be a surprise attack, they believed that the initial attack was just a distraction.Several weeks before the operation, a deceive plan led German people to mistake the main landing area. They believed that the Allied would land on Calais-the nearest point to Britain, not Normandy.he success of fake information, the Allied troops could land on the beach of Normandy. They divided it into four parts and gave code individually-Omaha, Juno, Sword, and Gold. The whole landing process was very fluent, except Omaha beach. The bombing from the Allied airforce didn't cause too much damage to the German defensive engineer structure. American army fist division, who responsible for Omaha beach, encountered serious resistance from German soldiers. After having great efforts, the first division took Omaha beach finally. The landing operation took a whole day. As of midnight that day, the Allies had consolidated their beachhead positions and advanced inland from Golden Beach, Juneau Beach, Sword Beach, and Utah Beach.

                  	<p><span class="joint">&#9658;</span>Although the Allied forces had held their power in France at the end of D-Day, they still faced the risk of being pushed back to the beach by German military.They must replenish their men at a faster rate than the German army.In the narrow lanes and heavily guarded Normandy towns, the progress of the Allied forces was considerably slow.However, the Allied forces have surpassed the enemy in number and have air force advantages, so after paying a high price, the Allied forces have overcome this huge resistance. As of late August 1944, when the Allied forces liberated Paris, about 10% of the 2 million Allied soldiers who had arrived in France had been dead, wounded, or missing.</p></section>

                  	<h5>[Sec.#4] How many soldiers engaged?</h5>
                    <p><span class="joint">&#9658;</span>As many as 7,000 ships and landing craft participated in the Normandy landing battle, and they transported 156,000 people and 10,000 tanks to the five Normandy beaches carefully selected by the Allies.Without the support of a large number of air force and navy, this landing would be impossible. The navy and air force of the Allied forces had already surpassed that of Germany.But on D-Day, as many as 4,400 Allied soldiers died and 9,000 were injured or missing. The total number of German casualties on that day is unknown, and it is estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000.Thousands of French civilians were killed in the fighting, mainly due to bombing attacks by the Allied forces.</p>
