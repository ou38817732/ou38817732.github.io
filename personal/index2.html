        		  <h1>The FDA will soon decide on Merck's Covid-19 antiviral pill. It shows promise, but there are also concerns</h1>
        		<section>
        			<h2>[Sec.#1]</h2>
        		    <p><span class="joint"> &#9658; </span>In the fall of 2015, Dr. Mark Denison was preparing for a long drive home from Alabama after making a presentation at a scientific meeting when a colleague asked him to stick around for lunch and check out some data on a potential new drug.
                    Denison said yes, and six years later, he's very glad he stayed.Denison's colleague, George Painter, is a "drug hunter" at Emory University in Atlanta. At lunch, he showed Denison lab results he'd obtained with a new antiviral compound, now known as molnupiravir."It just knocked my socks off," said Denison, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "With increasing concentrations of the drug, the virus's ability to grow just plummeted.

                   <h3>[Sec.#2]</h3>                   
                    <p><span class="joint">&#9658;</span>"Painter's lab looked at the effect molnupiravir had against the influenza virus and chikungunya, a virus that's spread by mosquitos. After the Alabama meeting, Painter sent some of the compound to Denison, who tried it in his lab against the virus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome."It blew us away at how effective it was," Denison remembers.At the time, neither Painter nor Denison -- nor anyone -- knew that another significant potential real-world application for molnupiravir lay ahead.It's to fight off SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

                  	<h4>[Sec.#3]</h4>
                  	<p><span class="joint">&#9658;</span>Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics now own molnupiravir, and on November 30, a team  of infectious disease advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration will look at results of their clinical trial and decide whether to recommend emergency use authorization for the drug to treat early-stage Covid-19.The results, which have yet to be reviewed by the FDA or published in a medical journal, are quite stunning: the pill reduced hospitalizations and death by about 50%, according to an October press release from Merck."I've wanted to shout from the rooftops about molnupiravir, so this is like sending our baby off to college," Denison said.</p>
                  	<p><span class="joint">&#9658;</span>But it's not clear what kind of report card that baby will get.Molnupiravir works in a somewhat uncommon way, and there are concerns it could be unsafe for developing fetuses. The company's clinical trials did not include pregnant women, and Daria Hazuda, who leads Merck's molnupiravir research, says the FDA might limit its use in pregnant women.There are also concerns that the pill could lead to the development of vaccine-resistant Covid-19 mutations. Hazuda said Merck's research shows the drug does not lead to such strains.At the end of the day, the FDA and its advisers will have to use the available data to weigh whether the drug is worth its potential risks."We should worry about the dangers to pregnant women and the dangers of developing resistance. But if we have a drug that works, we want that drug. We just have to figure out how best to use it given its limitations," said Dr. Eric Rubin, an infectious disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
